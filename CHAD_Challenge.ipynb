    "A categorical feature is a feature that has classes instead of numerical values. For example Sex, and Embarked are all categorical features because they are not floats and have distinct values that represent each possible class (for example male or female). Pclass could be considered a categorical feature two because it is not continuous. Name is also categorical because, but it is a one class per one observation, so it is not helpful.\n",

    "\n",
    "* [One Hot Encode](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) the feature, which spreads out the feature into several features which are 1 for if the class is present and 0 otherwise.\n",
